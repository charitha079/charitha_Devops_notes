HISTORY OF Linux 
=================

  Before Linux – UNIX (1960s–1970s)
  --------------------------------
> Linux is inspired by UNIX, an operating system developed in the 1960s at Bell Labs.
> UNIX was powerful and stable but not free and mostly used in universities and big companies.

  Minix (1970-1980s)
  -----------------
> Minix is developed based on UNIX operating system..It is a small os which is helpful for studenta and opensource.
 
  Windows (1980s)
  --------------
> Microsoft Windows is a graphical operating system developed by Microsoft.
  
    🖥️ User-friendly GUI
    🔐 Good security (Defender, BitLocker)
    📦 Wide software support
    🧑‍💻 Best for beginners
    🎮 Strong gaming support
	
	
  Linux (1990s)
  ------------
  Birth of Linux (1991)
> In 1991, a student named Linus Torvalds from Finland created a kernel as a hobby project.
> He announced it on the internet as a free alternative to UNIX.
> This kernel was named Linux 🐧.

 Why Linux is Important??

✔ Free & Open Source
✔ Secure & Stable
✔ Highly customizable
✔ Best for servers, cloud, and DevOps.
OPEN SOURCE: open source means a software whose code is open and free for everyone to use, see, change and share.



STRUCTURE OF LINUX:
==================
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   User Applications (ls,cp,vim,docker)          |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   Shell (Interface between user and kernel..    |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   System Call Layer (grep,systemctl,openssl)    |
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   Linux Kernel(process Mangement,Memory management,file management, Network management|
+-------------------------------------------------+
|   Hardware (CPU,Ram,Disk,network)               |
+-------------------------------------------------+



DISTRIBUTIONS OF Linux:
======================
There are different distributions in linux..some of them are
> Debian based and RPM based

1️⃣ Debian Family
---------------
> Debian – Very stable
> Ubuntu – Beginner-friendly
> Linux Mint – Windows-like UI
 📦 Package manager: apt
 
2️⃣ Red Hat Family
----------------
> RedHat Enterprise Linux – Enterprise use
> CentOS – Community version
> Fedora – Cutting-edge features
📦 Package manager: dnf / yum


What is package manager??
It is helpful for managing the packages (python,Java..) i.e.,deploying, upgrading, deleting and maintaining the packages..

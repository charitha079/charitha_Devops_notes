USER MANANGEMENT:
================

What is user management ??
User management in Linux is used to create, delete, and maintain user accounts.
It helps the system administrator to control who can access the system and what actions they can perform.


Why Companies Need User Management ??

1️. Security 🔐:
   ------------
  Company data is very important.
  Without user management:
> Any employee could see salaries
> Anyone could delete data
> High risk of data leak


2. Right Access to Right Person:
   ----------------------------

Only give necessary access.
Example:
> Developer ❌ should not access HR payroll
> HR ❌ should not access production servers

     Each role needs different access.

            Role			What they can access
           ------------------------------------------
		    HR	            Employee details, salary
            Developer	    Code, servers
            Tester	        Testing tools
            Manager        	Reports
            Admin	        Everything
			
> sudo - do as a super user.. other than root user remaining all users are non root users(normal users) then don't have control on system they 
         only have control on home directory..		
			
> If a normal users wants to execute system related permissions they have to use this sudo permissions.




Basic Linux Commands for User Creation and Management:
-----------------------------------------------------

## useradd <user-name> ------> useradd charitha  {charitha user is created.. this is the command used to create a user}
## userdel <user-name> ------> userdel charitha  {charitha user is deleted}
## passwd  <user-name> ------> passwd charitha   {to create password for the user}
## adduser <user-name> ------> adduser charitha  {same as useradd for adding the user.
                                                  User-friendly version of useradd
                                                  > Automatically:
                                                  > Creates home directory
                                                  > Asks for user details (Full name, phone, etc.)
                                                  > Sets password during creation.}

>> we can check whether the user is created or not using "cat /etc/passwd" or "vim /etc/passwd".
>> similarly password info will be provided under the "cat /etc/shadow".

Enforcing password policies:
---------------------------
## change -M 90   -------------------> for changing the password.
## passwd -l <user-name>  -----------> This command is used for locking the user. As an administrative user you found someone is misusing their account
                                       then to lock that user you can use this command.
## passwd -u <user-name>  -----------> for unlocking the user.




GROUP IN USER MANAGEMENT:
-------------------------

A group is just a collection of users.

👉 Instead of giving permissions to each user one by one, we:

  1. Put users into a group
  2. Give permissions to the group
  3. All users in that group automatically get those permissions
     📌 Shortcut idea:
     User → Group → Permissions
	 
	 
GROUP MANAGEMENT COMMANDS:
--------------------------
## groupadd <group-name> ---------> groupadd linux { this command is to add a group}
## groupdel <group-name> ---------> groupdel linux { To delete the group}

>> Now what if you want to add a user in that linux group.. yes.. there is a command..
## usermod -aG <group-name> <user-name> ----------> usermod -aG linux charitha -----------> {under linux group charitha user is created}

>> where to checkout whether the group is created or not..
## cat /etc/group

questions:
=========
1. As we know all the user information is under the passwd file.. Now what if passwd file got deleted ..??
>> There is a shadow file for passwd which is nothing but "passwd-"
   "ls /etc/passwd-" from this we cna make back up by simply running a command called..
   "cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd"
   similarly..
   "ls /etc/shadow-" this is backup for "ls /etc/shadow"
   "ls /etc/group-" backup for  "ls /etc/group"
   
2. what if you forgot your user account password is there a way to restore it ??
>> No , we cannot restore it back.


## ls /etc/sudoers
 👉 It shows detailed information about the /etc/sudoers file, such as:
     1.File permissions
     2.Owner
     3.Group
     4.File size
     5.Last modified date
